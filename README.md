## Open Source Software (OSS) Progress Report
A place to keep track of all my open source contributions and the progress reports

## Use Case
- Weekly progress log and thoughts
- Elaboration of selected contributions and implementations
- Link to related resources
- As a guide/introductory material for new developers to get a sense of a contributor journey
- As evidence/summary of contributions done, possibly as part of a/an:
  - school module requirement
  - software engineering program
  - internship
  - fellowship
  - official open source work
  - etc

## Pros
- Write with Markdown
- Online editing with Github GUI
- Easy to sharing with others
- Reference to Github repos/issues/PRs directly
- Options to convert Markdown files into more visually appealing formats in the future

## Cons
- When involving sensitive information
- Initial/potential reliance on usage of Github
- Familiarity with Markdown syntax

---

## Development
I will be testing it out and tweaking this to suit my needs. If it is somehow relevant and useful to others, I will make further updates to:
- potentially make this into a repo template for easier adaptation
- include a proper how-to-use guide for anyone who share the use cases above and want to use this as a starting point to their OSS Progress Report
